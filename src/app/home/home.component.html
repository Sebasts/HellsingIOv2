    <h2>Hello reader! Dear reader...</h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    I am Sebastian, and I am a techologist. <br />
    I have spent my career working up the IT stack. HelpDesk, Sys Admin, Network
    Admin, Server Admin, Software Developer. I've been exposed to nearly
    everything within the typical IT environment.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have a passion for tech, information technology in particular. <br />
    I am currently building and maintaining full stack Java webapps and apis, as
    well as scheduled and batch processes to facilitate after hours maintenance
    of applications and data manipulation.
    <br />
    <br />
    You can find me usually writing a lot of Java, tied to a mysql or oracle
    database, or powering a dynamic angular front end. <br />
    Although... these are just tools and as an engineer, I can do the same job
    with almost any tool with a little prep time.
