        <h2>Hello reader! Dear reader...</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        I am Sebastian, and I am a techologist. <br />
        I have spent my career working up the IT stack. HelpDesk, Sys Admin, Network
        Admin, Server Admin, Software Developer. I've been exposed to nearly
        everything within the typical IT environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a passion for tech, information technology in particular. <br />
        I am currently building and maintaining full stack Java webapps and apis, as
        well as scheduled and batch processes to facilitate after hours maintenance
        of applications and data manipulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can find me usually writing a lot of Java, tied to a mysql or oracle
        database, or powering a dynamic angular front end. <br />
        Although... these are just tools and as an engineer, I can do the same job
        with almost any tool with a little prep time.
